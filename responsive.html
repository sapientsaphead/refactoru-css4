		    <h1>Responsive web design</h1>

		    <p><span class="keyword">Responsive web design (RWD)</span> is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal 
		    viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across 
		    a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors).[1][2][3]</p>

			<p>A site designed with RWD[1][4] adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, 
			proportion-based grids,[5] flexible images,[6][7][8][9] and CSS3 media queries,[3][10][11] an 
			extension of the @media rule.[12]</p>

			<ul>

				<li>The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages,
				 rather than absolute units like pixels or points.[5]</li>
				<li>Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside 
				their containing element.[6]</li>
				<li>Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the 
				device the site is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.</li>
				<li>Server-side components (RESS) in conjunction with client-side ones such as media queries can 
				produce faster-loading sites for access over cellular networks and also deliver richer functionality/
				usability avoiding some of the pitfalls of device-side-only solutions.[13]</li>

				<h2>Related concepts</h2>

				<h3>Mobile first, unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement</h3>
				<p>"Mobile first", unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement (strategies for when a new site
				 design is being considered) are related concepts that predated RWD: browsers of basic mobile phones do
				  not understand JavaScript or media queries, so the recommended practice is to create a basic web site,
				   and enhance it for smart phones and PCs—rather than try graceful degradation to make a complex, image-
				   heavy site work on the most basic mobile phones.[14][15][16][17]</p>

				<h3>Progressive enhancement based on browser-, device-, or feature-detection</h3>
				<p>Where a web site must support basic mobile devices that lack JavaScript, browser ("user agent") 
				detection (also called "browser sniffing"), and mobile device detection[15][18] are two ways of deducing 
				if certain HTML and CSS features are supported (as a basis for progressive enhancement)—however, these 
				methods are not completely reliable unless used in conjunction with a device capabilities database.</p>

				<p>For more capable mobile phones and PCs, JavaScript frameworks like Modernizr, jQuery, and jQuery Mobile
				that can directly test browser support for HTML/CSS features (or identify the device or user agent) are 
				popular. Polyfills can be used to add support for features—e.g. to support media queries (required for 
				RWD), and enhance HTML5 support, on Internet Explorer. Feature detection also might not be completely reliable: 
				some may report that a feature is available, when it is either missing or so poorly implemented that it is 
				effectively nonfunctional.[19][20]</p>

				<h2>Challenges, and other approaches</h2>
				<p>Ethan Marcotte coined the term responsive web design (RWD) in a May 2010 article in A List Apart.[1] He 
				described the theory and practice of responsive web design in his brief 2011 book titled Responsive Web Design. 
				Responsive design was listed as #2 in Top Web Design Trends for 2012 by .net magazine[36] after progressive 
				enhancement at #1. They also listed 20 of Ethan Marcotte's favourite responsive sites.[2]</p>

				<p>Mashable called 2013 the Year of Responsive Web Design.[37] Many other sources have recommended responsive 
				design as a cost-effective alternative to mobile applications.[38]</p>

				<p>Forbes explains why you need to prioritize responsive design right now.[39]</p>

				<p>In late 2012, Google recommended responsive design in its Webmaster’s Guide: “Google recommends 
				webmasters follow the industry best practice of using responsive web design, namely serving the same 
				HTML for all devices and using only CSS media queries to decide the rendering on each device.” [40]</p>
