#### Background

The time is now to treat mobile devices as first-class citizens. Mobile devices have eclipsed desktop web usage. Responsive Design is the set of principles and techniques that allow you to serve a single codebase that adapts to different devices. Media Queries, a new feature in CSS3, is the primary enabler. Instead of building two completely different codebases, one for mobile and one for desktop, we design a single site with a few rules defined for how elements should adapt within different devices.

Read the articles provided above to gain an understanding of the principles of Responsive Web Design then follow the instructions below to put them into practice.

#### Requirements
1. Create a static HTML page based on the contents of this Wikipedia page.
2. Include the main content in a container that takes up at most 850px.
3. Add some padding to the container on devices smaller than 850px.
4. A sidebar that takes up 30% width but becomes no smaller than 320px.
5. Add a navigation bar that restructures itself into a more mobile-friendly design on smaller devices.
6. Add a couple fluid-width images, i.e. they adapt to the size of the page.
7. Add an Image Gallery of Responsive Design examples that degrades into a vertical stack on smaller devices.
